# We use node:18 as the base for building and installing dependencies.

# If these files don't change, subsequent builds can skip 'npm install'.

RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application source code

# Stage 2: Create the Final Production Image
# We use node:18 as the runtime image with all the necessary tools.

# Run the application using the non-root user (recommended for security)
