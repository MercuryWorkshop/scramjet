Scramjet is an interception-based web proxy which is the successor to Ultraviolet. It is designed with security, developer friendliness, and performance in mind. Scramjet strives to have a clean, organized codebase to improve maintainability. Scramjet is made to evade internet censorship and bypass arbitrary web browser restrictions.

## Supported Sites

Some of the popular websites that Scramjet supports include:

-   [Google](https://google.com)
-   [Spotify](https://spotify.com)
-   [Discord](https://discord.com)
-   [Reddit](https://reddit.com)
-   [GeForce NOW](https://play.geforcenow.com/)
-   [now.gg](https://now.gg)

## Development

### Dependencies

-   Recent versions of `node.js` and `pnpm`
-   `rustup`
-   `wasm-bindgen`
-   [Binaryen's `wasm-opt`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen)
-   [this `wasm-snip` fork](https://github.com/r58Playz/wasm-snip)

#### Building

-   Clone the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/scramjet`
-   Install the dependencies with `pnpm i`
-   Build the rewriter with `pnpm rewriter:build`
-   Build Scramjet with `pnpm build`

### Running Scramjet Locally

You can run the Scramjet dev server with the command

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Scramjet should now be running at http://localhost:1337 and should rebuild upon a file being changed (excluding the rewriter).

## Extra documentation

There's [a page on TN's docs](https://docs.titaniumnetwork.org/proxies/scramjet) for Scramjet, which is structured more like a guide if you are an interested proxy site developer.
